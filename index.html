      <p>My school worked hard for debate. The didn't give up and always perservered. Luckily, it paid off. It was the last minute of debate. there was one more defence our team could make to win the competition. After they said it, the opponent stared in awe. That's when we realized, they didn't have and defence. We burst in cheers.</p>

            <p>My school has always wanted to win the soccer tournament. This year, they fulfilled their dream. We were play against the strongest team in the state. At halftime, we were losing 20-18. After that, they showed their full potential. At the end, they won 34-28. It was amazing.</p>

        <p>Our school recently was renovated. It took a year and a half. Finally, after a long boring one and a half years, they finally reopened the school. I walk inside it and the first thing I see is a brand new canteen. It is marvelous with all its upgraded chairs and tables.</p>
        <img src="st2.jpg" class="img-responsive">
        <hr>
        <p>The library is HUGE. There are couches and tons more shelves of books. There organized it a little more and painted the walls. Now, the library looks totally different from the one I saw one and a half years ago.</p>

        <p>One thing my school added this year is the auditorium. It is massive. I think this is where we are going to do our assembly. If that's true, I would be extremely delighted. Before, we had to stand outside on the sand, hearing announcements. Now, at least we can sit down and not have stand up litterally all the time.</p>
